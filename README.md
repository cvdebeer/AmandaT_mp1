##  Overview

In keeping with the music theme of the default project, I decided to code a website for my niece, who is an up and coming singer and songwriter. She is hoping to be "discovered" and signed by a record label and also needs a place for potential clients to find her and contact her to book her for functions. She needs a site that can show case her talents and give her user a view of who she is and what she has to offer.

## UX
The artist requested that I design her a site that she could provide to potential clients and agents. 
Using [Balsamiq](assets/AmandaT_wirefame.pdf) (click to open) I designed a site that I believe would best answer that need by taking into consideration and answering the following needs:  
ðŸ”¸ This user would be interested in getting to know the artist's style of music. To this end I created:-
- The "Home" section gives a few snaps of the artist, and shares her passion for music.
- The "Music" section, showcases some of her original and cover songs, showing her range of music genres.  
  - I presented the original songs in video format linked to her YouTube posts. This allows the user to see her passion for the songs that she writes and sings.
  - I presented the cover songs as audio, using album covers to trigger the users memory and identify the original artist. The album cover flips so that the user can go the the original song and compare if they want to.
  
ðŸ”¸ The user would also want to be able to contact the artist in order to hire her for gigs/functions or set up a meeting for a collaboration. To this end I created :-
- Two points of getting in touch 
    - First ~ with the "Get in Touch" button that users can press which will take them immediately to the "Contact Form" Modal
    - Second ~ through the "Contact" link in the menu, which also takes them through to the "Contact Form" Modal.
  
ðŸ”¸ The user might not want to contact the artist immediately and might want to see where the artist is performing in public, before hiring the artist or offering a record deal. To this end I created:-
- The "Events" section of the website, which shows up and coming public performances. This also allows any fans the opportunity to book tickets to see her perform.

ðŸ”¸ The user might want to see what the artist is currently working on or has been up to recently. To this end I created :-
- The "News" section of the site. In this section we have shown her latest public performance on TV (showing potential agents that she is being noticed). I also showcased her latest song, by making the lyrics available and providing a click through to the audio track.



## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features

...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

***HTML*** ~ main Language used to structure the sections of my website.  
***CSS*** ~ styling language used to format and visually build upon the accompanying HTML.  
***Bootstrap Framework*** ~ <https://getbootstrap.com/> ~ Used as the core structuring layout building blocks of the website, ensuring mobile-frist design and responsive size display.  
***AWS Cloud9 and Visual Studio Code*** ~ Cloud9 was used as the initial IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for this project. VS code was coming highly recommended by other students, so I changed over due mainly to being kicked out of Cloud9 every hour.   
***Git*** ~ <https://git-scm.com/>~ Used to commit to local repository and further push to Github Repo ensuring version controlling of the project build. Originally used through Cloud9 and then downloaded to use in VScode.  
***Github*** ~ <https://github.com/>~ Used to host the deployed website and repository of all previous versions of the build.  
***Google Chrome Developer Tools*** ~ Used as the core testing mechanism throughout the project build to see what the repsonsiveness accross all devices.  
***ColorRules*** ~ <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/colorrules/id1198369052> (Colour Picker) ~ Application used to obtain hexadecimal/rgba/hsl values of colours. It provides different varations of colour choices depending on the base colour you select.
***Balsamiq*** ~ <https://balsamiq.com/>~ Used for the Creation of my initial Wireframes for my project.  
***Pix-resizer*** ~ <https://pixresizer.windows10compatible.com/> ~ Programme used to make my images smaller without losing the aspect ratio.  
***Any Video converter*** ~ <https://www.any-video-converter.com/> ~ Used to change video into audio files.


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
JQuery 


## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form: 
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
