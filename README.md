# H1 Amanda T. - Milestone Project 1
ðŸ”¸ Web-Application Name : Amanda T.
ðŸ”¸ Author : Claudia De Beer

# H2 Overview

I decided to code a website for my niece, who is an up and coming singer and songwriter, who is hoping to be "discovered" and signed by a record label. She needs a site that can show case her talents and give ther user a view of who she is.


One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

# H2 UX
This site is aimed at potential clients that may want to hire the musician for a function. It is also aimed at potential agents.
The focus of the site is to provide potential clients and agents with information about the musician, they type of music they perform and to showcase their talent.
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

# H2 Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

# H2 Technologies Used

HTML ~ main Language used to structure the individual pages of the website.
CSS ~ styling language used to format and visually build upon the accompanying HTML.
Bootstrap Framework ~ Used as the core structuring layout building blocks of the website, ensuring mobile-frist design and responsive size display.
AWS Cloud9 ~ Cloud9 was used as the IDE for this project.
 ~ Used to commit to local repository and further push to Github Repo ensuring version controlling of the project build.
Git ~ Installed on local device and integrated to PyCharm as a Plugin to enable version controlling.
Github ~ Used to host the deployed website and repository of all previous versions of the build.
Google Chrome Developer Tools ~ Used as the core test phase throughout the project build life, testing the responsiveness of elements and CSS visuals.
ColourRules (Color Picker) ~ Application used to obtain hexadecimal/rgba/hsl values of colours.
Some Imported Javascript & JQuery ~ For the Modal and Responsive Navbar expand & collapse functionality.
Balsamiq ~ Used for the Creation of Wireframes.
Pix-resiser ~ to make images smaller
Any Video converter ~ to change video into audio files


In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
JQuery 
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

# H2 Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form: 
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# H2 Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
